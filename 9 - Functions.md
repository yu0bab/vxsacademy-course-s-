# What Are Functions?
So let's talk about something you already know but don't know the name of: functions.
We've been using functions this whole time! Rect, ellipse, line, and text are all examples of functions.
They are chunks of code that we're given a name so we can use them more easily. Behind the scenes, the rect function is actually just 4 lines. Aren't you glad that you only have to type "rect(200, 200, 20, 20);" instead of 4 lines?
