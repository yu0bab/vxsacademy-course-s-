# What Are Functions?
So let's talk about something you already know but don't know the name of: functions.
We've been using functions this whole time! Rect, ellipse, line, and text are all examples of functions.
They are chunks of code that were given a name so we can use them more easily. Behind the scenes, the rect function is actually just 4 lines. Aren't you glad that you only have to type "rect(200, 200, 20, 20);" instead of 4 lines?

In a way, we use functions in our daily lives. When you make breakfast, you probably get a bowl, pour cereal, pour milk, and get a spoon to eat it with. That’s a function, because a list of instructions grouped together and given a name: making breakfast. You don’t have to say the entire procedure, because everyone will understand you if you say "making breakfast"

# Custom Functions
I want to make a clone of Preston. **[add the code for him here]** I could copy and paste the code for him, but what if I want to make a change to both? And what if I want to add a third or fourth Preston? It'd be nice if we could make our own functions to make this easier.
