# Intro
Hey, check out what I'm working on. This code makes 2 portals, and there's a ball I want to go through them. **If** I can figure out how to make this work, this will be pretty cool!
```js
//write code for a portal
```
So letâ€™s see, I want the ball to go to the left portal **IF** it went through the right portal, and the other way around. So far all of the code we've been writing will always run, no matter what. How can we get certain pieces of code to only run in specific cases? (Hint: **IF** you saw that I'm writing the word **IF** in bold letters, you might see where this is going)

# If Statements
The way we get code to run only under certain conditions is with an if statement. Here's how you write one:
```js
//replace "condition" with the condition you want.
if(condition){
    //code to run
}
```
If the condition is true, the code will run, or else it will ignore the code inside. But how do you write conditions?
