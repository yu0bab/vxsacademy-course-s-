# Intro
Hey, check this out. This code makes 2 portals, and there's a ball I want to go through them. **If** I can figure out how to make this work, this will be pretty cool!
```js
//write code for a portal
```
So letâ€™s see, I want the ball to go to the left portal **IF** it went through the right portal, and the other way around. How can we do that?
