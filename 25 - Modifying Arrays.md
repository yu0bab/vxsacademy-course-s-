# Intro
Preston finally learned to read minds, and he wants to celebrate! Preston is hosting a party, and he wants to list everyone that is invited. Here's his list so far:
```js
var invitedPeople = ["Preston (obviously)", "Bobert", "Boberta", "Vexcess", "Prof. Cobra", "The Student that got this far (you)"];
```
Let's say that Boberta wasn't being nice, so she's no longer invited (Boberta is actually very nice, but let's pretend). We could simply edit the code, but what if we want to modify the array after the fact? Maybe Preston wants to make a program where people can ask to be invited to this party. Most people don't like going into the code and editing it just to add themselves onto a list, so how can we make it automatic?
