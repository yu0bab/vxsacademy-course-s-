# Intro
So let's say I want to resize the stickman's head. First we'll need his head
(I put his face in the center so it will be easier to do this):
```
fill(0, 0, 0); //face color
ellipse(200, 200, 100, 100); //face

fill(255, 255, 255); //eye color
ellipse(180, 190, 20, 20); //eyes
ellipse(220, 190, 20, 20);
ellipse(200, 220, 40, 20);
```
So how do we go about resizing his head? Like always, try doing it yourself.
(+ is addition, - is subtraction, * is multiplication, and / is division)
