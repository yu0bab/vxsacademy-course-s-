# Code Blocks
If you're planning on writing a lot of code, you might want to know how to organize your code so it's easier to navigate. This is not only convenient, but it helps with debugging too! Often when you're debugging, you have to go from one chunk of code to the next, which takes a lot of time. So having organized code is almost essential. One way you can do it is with code blocks. First, let me show you how to make one:
```js
{
//code goes here
} //and I like adding a comment right here so I understand what's going on the inside
```
You may notice an arrow to the left of the {. If you click it, all the code gets collapsed, and all that shows is "...". The code's still there, just hidden. And sure, you could use this to just hide away unorganized code, but that's a bit lazy, and doesn't do anything good for us. You could instead use this to organize your code. For example, let's say you're making a game, and one code block is for the player, one is for the enemies, another is for the game elements, another for the menus, etc. Or maybe you're making a drawing of a forest, and one code block is the trees, one is the grass, and one is some other details. Reguardless of how you use them, they are great for organizing your code!

# Code Bock Tips
There are actually multiple types of code blocks, for even more organization:
```js
//commented out curly brackets
//{

//code goes here

//}


//commented out square brackets
//[

//code goes here

//]
```

And if you want to collapse all the code blocks at once, you can do `ctrl + alt + 0`. Pretty neat, huh?
