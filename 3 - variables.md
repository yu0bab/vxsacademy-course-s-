# Intro to Variables
Hey, you wanna see something cool I made?
```
fill(0, 0, 0);
ellipse(200, 200, 100, 100);

strokeWeight(20);
line(200, 200, 100, 150);
line(200, 200, 300, 150);
line(200, 200, 100, 250);
line(200, 200, 300, 250);
```
It's a stickman! You can see him properly if you copy and paste it [here](https://vxsacademy.org/computer-programming/new/pjs)
Hmm, actually I want the arms to be longer. So I'll change them like this:
```
//code
```
No, a bit longer:
```
//code
```
And now that's too long. This is a bit of a pain, because I have to change both
numbers every single time. It'd be nice if I only had to change just one number,
and it did the other for me. Oh wait, there is a way to 

# variables
Variables in programming are a way to store things so we can use them later on,
which is useful if you're going to use something over and over again, like in
the example with the stickman. How you make a variable is like this:
```
//You can replace "variableName" with whatever you want the name to be, as long as you don't use spaces.
var variableName;
```
And then you have to give it something to store, like so:
```
variableName = 1; //The = sign in programing basically means "assign". So "variableName = 1;" means "assign variableName to 1"
```
So for our
