# Intro
I decided to give myself a little coding challenge, which helps a lot with learning programming. My challenge I gave myself is I have an array of random numbers 1 through 100, and I want to find the sum of all the numbers that are greater than 50. Here's my code (feel free to try it out yourself before you look):
```js
var array = [85, 5, 35, 87, 73, 90, 72, 44, 70, 82, 48, 93, 32, 39, 9, 88, 36, 46, 11, 46];
var sum = 0;

for(var i = 0; i < array.length; i ++){
    if(i < ){}
}
```
