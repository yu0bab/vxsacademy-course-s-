# Intro
I wrote this program where you answer a few questions, and it will tell you which vexcees academy avatar you are. Here's the code:
```js
//code
```
You have to answer the questions by editing the code, which isn't really the best way to do it, but thatâ€™s not why I brought it up. I brought it up because it's not working quite right.

# Println function
There is a function that is small but mighty and is great for debugging called the println function. Here's how you write it:
```js
println("Hello World!");
```
It displays text in a window that pops up. Try it out to see it work. What makes it so useful? It lets you understand what the computer is doing in the background, which is an essential when debugging. Here's the println function in action:
```js
//code
```
