# Value Types
If you are an artist, you probably know that there are many different tools, and they're used for different things. Pencils are used for drawing, crayons are used for coloring, erasers are used for erasing, brushes are used for painting, tablets are used for digital art and animation, and so on so forth. When you use them together in the right ways, you can make some pretty amazing art (of course, you need other things for great art, like practice, good ideas, references, etc.). Just like with art utensils, there are many programing "utensils" called value types. You already know of a few, like numbers, strings of text, and functions. They're all used for different things, like how text is for words, and functions are to run certain chunks of code. I'm going to teach you a new value type: Boolean

Booleans, which were invented by George Boole, are an answer to a yes or no question (maybe isn't an answer tho)
