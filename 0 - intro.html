    <h1>What is Programming?</h1>
    <p>
        Programming, to put it simply, is a list of instructions we give to a computer. It's like a recipe for computers, and
        programmers are the "food artists" making the recipies.

        A programming language, or computer language, is what you use to tell the computer what to do. There are many programming
        languages out there like Javascript, Python, C++, and Java (all of which are taught here on Vexcess Academy by the way).
        We will be using "Processing.js", which is a tool made for Javascript (one of the programming languages) to draw stuff,
        and even create animations! Don't worry, both Javascript and Processing.js use english words, so it should be easy to learn.
    </p>

    <h1>Why should I learn?</h1>
    <p>
        Think of all the things that are done with computers: websites, games, apps, robots, the internet, 3D animation, they're used
        to make the special effects for movies, and they even put the first person on the moon! So if you want to learn how to make
        computers to do anything like that, you're in the right place!

        You might be thinking "How does this course relate to all those things?". Well for one, you can make games with
        Processing.js. Pretty cool, right? And for two, the basic principles we will teach you in this course expand to more complex
        programs, even Artificial Intelligence which will take over the world.

    <h1>What will I need?</h1>
    <p>
        For this course, all you will need is a computer, and <a href = "https://vxsacademy.org/computer-programming/new/pjs">a programming environment</a>, which is just a place to write programs.

        Other than that, you will also need typing skills and a good understanding of math and logic, because programming uses
        a <strong>lot</strong> of it! But don't worry, we'll keep it as simple as possible, and explain everything along the way.
