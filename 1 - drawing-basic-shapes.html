    <h1>Coordinate system</h1>
    <p>
      Before we do anything with Processing.js, I should talk about Coordinate systems. A Coordinate system is
      just how we describe position with numbers. If you were to tell me where your pencil is, you might say
      "it's 1 inch to the right of my paper". You probably wouldn't say exactly how far way your pencil is from
      your paper like that, but that's the basics of a coordinate system. It says how far away to the right or
      left something is, and also how far up and down it is.

      Us programmers like consistancy, so we use a <strong>reference point</strong>, which is a point we all
      agree on for the Coordinate system. So instead of saying "1 inch to the right of my paper", you would
      say "1 inch to the right of the reference point". In Processing.js, the reference point is always
      in the top left corner.

    <h1>Basic Shapes</h1>
    <p>
      There are several shapes you can make with Processing.js, like rectangles, ellipses (or ovals), triangles,
      and if you stick with me, even custom shapes! I'll start you off with rectangles.
