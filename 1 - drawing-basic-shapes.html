    <h1>Coordinate system</h1>
    <p>
      Before we do anything with Processing.js, I should talk about Coordinate systems. A Coordinate system is
      just how we describe position with numbers. If you were to tell me where your pencil is, you might say
      "it's 1 inch to the right of my paper". You probably wouldn't say exactly how far way your pencil is from
      your paper like that, but that's the basics of a coordinate system. It says how far away to the right or
      left something is, and also how far up and down it is.

      Us programmers like consistancy, so we use a <strong>reference point</strong>, which is a point we all
      agree on for the Coordinate system. So instead of saying "1 inch to the right of my paper", you would
      say "1 inch to the right of the reference point". In Processing.js, the reference point is always
      in the top left corner.

      The left/righgt value is called the X vlaue, and up/down is called the Y value.

    <h1>Basic Shapes</h1>
    <p>
      There are several shapes you can make with Processing.js, like rectangles, ellipses (or ovals), triangles,
      and if you stick with me, even custom shapes! I'll start you off with rectangles.

      To make rectangles, you write this (try it out for youself <a href = "https://vxsacademy.org/computer-programming/new/pjs">here</a>):
    </p>
    <code>
        rect(200, 200, 20, 20);
    </code>
    <p>
        What do those numbers mean? Try changing them, see what they do. (PRO TIP: if you click one of the numbers,
        you'll see an icon pop above the number. You can drag it to the left and right to adjust the numbers.)

        If you messed around with the numbers, you will notice that the first one means how far to the left or
        right the square is (the X value), the second one is how far up or down it is (the Y value), the third
        one is the width, and the fourth one is the height.

        "Ok, but are we measuring in Meters? Feet? Milimeters? Inches?". Actually, we're measuring in pixels.
        If you don't know, pixels are tiny little squares that make up the screen you're looking at. Try
        getting close to your screen, you might see them.
