# Else If Statements 
In the last lesson we got Preston to guess a number, and we told him if he's right or not. Here's the code for it:
```js
//code
```
In this lesson, I want to be able to tell him more: if his guess is too big, too small, or if he got it right. Here's one way I can do that:
```js
//code
```
And yeah, it works, but there's a better way to do it:
```js
//code
```
It works in the exact same way. So why do we care? We care because we can use multiple else if statements like this:
```js
//code
```
