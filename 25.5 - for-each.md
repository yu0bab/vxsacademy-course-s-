# Intro
Remember the list of people invited to Preston's party last lesson? If not, here's the list:

I want to display each person in the list. We can simply use a loop for that:
```js
var invitedPeople = [];

for(var i = 0; i < invitedPeople.length; i ++){
  text(invitedPeople[i], 20, i*20);
}
```
But when it comes to arrays, there's actually a more convenient way of looping through them all.
