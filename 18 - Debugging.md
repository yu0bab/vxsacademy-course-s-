# Debugging
Let's say that you have a program that isn't working how you want it to. Programmers call it a bug. Debugging is when you fix these bugs. The hardest part is finding these bugs. There's a neat little function that can help help us, called the printing function. Here's how you use it:
```js
println("Hello world!");
```
What does it do? It prints text onto the screen (you were expecting something else, weren't you?).
